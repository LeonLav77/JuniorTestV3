# junior_test

This project is created as 2 separate parts: the frontend consisting of Vue, and the backend in pure PHP. To run it locally you need to host the php server, where all the requests are routed through index.php (in this project its done with use of wamp and a .htaccess file). To run the frontend you cd into the junior_test folder and npm i + npm run serve. Then you are all set
